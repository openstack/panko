features:

    A new ceilometer to panko publisher is created to avoid ceilometer
    collector dependency. This streamlines the process of pushing data to Panko
upgrade:
  - |
    In ceilometer.conf, remove `panko` from event_dispatchers. Add `panko://`
    to the publishers in event_pipeline.yaml
deprecations:
  - |
    The ceilometer to panko dispatcher is now deprecated. The publisher
    should be used going forward.
