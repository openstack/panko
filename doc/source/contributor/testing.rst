=================
Running the Tests
=================

Panko includes an extensive set of automated unit tests which are
run through tox_.

1. Install ``tox``::

   $ sudo pip install tox

2. On Ubuntu install ``mongodb`` and ``libmysqlclient-dev`` packages::

   $ sudo apt-get install mongodb
   $ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

   For Fedora20 there is no ``libmysqlclient-dev`` package, so youâ€™ll need
   to install ``mariadb-devel.x86-64`` (or ``mariadb-devel.i386``) instead::

   $ sudo yum install mongodb
   $ sudo yum install mariadb-devel.x86_64

3. Install the test dependencies::

   $ sudo pip install -r /opt/stack/panko/test-requirements.txt

4. Run the unit and code-style tests::

   $ cd /opt/stack/panko
   $ tox -e py27,pep8

   As tox is a wrapper around testr, it also accepts the same flags as testr.
   See the `testr documentation`_ for details about these additional flags.

.. _testr documentation: https://testrepository.readthedocs.org/en/latest/MANUAL.html

   Use a double hyphen to pass options to testr. For example, to run only tests under tests/api/v2::

      $ tox -e py27 -- api.v2

   To debug tests (ie. break into pdb debugger), you can use ''debug'' tox
   environment. Here's an example, passing the name of a test since you'll
   normally only want to run the test that hits your breakpoint::

       $ tox -e debug panko.tests.test_bin

   For reference, the ``debug`` tox environment implements the instructions
   here: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Testr#Debugging_.28pdb.29_Tests

5. There is a growing suite of tests which use a tool called `gabbi`_ to
   test and validate the behavior of the Panko API. These tests are run
   when using the usual ``py27`` tox target but if desired they can be run by
   themselves::

   $ tox -e gabbi

   The YAML files used to drive the gabbi tests can be found in
   ``panko/tests/gabbi/gabbits``. If you are adding to or adjusting the
   API you should consider adding tests here.
